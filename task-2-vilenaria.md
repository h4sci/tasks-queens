# my favorite comics 
-are the ones of DISNEY with Dagobert Duck, which I read in my childhood
-I would like to read some Italian comics to improve my Italian

# example tasks in research I hope to get help with: 
-I want to plot measurement data from mat files
-I also want to plot data, which is currently stored in xlsx files
-maybe I want to combine both types of data
-for that, I want to combine the data of several experiments (sometimes exps. 
1,2,3,4, then 1,2,5,6, then only 5,6, and so on)
-the data contains single values (as solid mass and liquid mass), the sizes of  
many objects which were observed in videos during the experiments, and their 
crystal size distributions
-I would like to add more plots over time, when I see that it might be 
interesting
